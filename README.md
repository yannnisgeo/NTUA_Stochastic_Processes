# NTUA_Stochastic_Processes

This repository hosts the exercises for the course of Stochastic Processes taught by Dr. 
Michail Loulakis at the National Technical University of Athens, as well as my solutions to them.

The main site of the course - where you can find the book together with other relevant material - can be found [here](http://mycourses.ntua.gr/course_description/index.php?cidReq=SEMFE1120).

To run the solutios, you need python (I run a venv with python 3.6.5) and the requirements specified in the requirements.txt file.

Being a course in Greek, the Greek language is used extensively in both the exercises and the solutions, sorry for that.

The lab supervisor the year I took the course was [TeoSakel](https://github.com/TeoSakel).
